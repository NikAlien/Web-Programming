                    Due to the players' flexibility and solid receives and digs, the Boys' Volleyball Club team is nicknamed "The Cats" 
                    which is also an allusion to the school name. The club banner reads "Connect" which often refers to the connection of plays.
                    <br><br>
                    Nekoma and Karasuno are said to be "destined rivals" because of the longtime competition between their respective coaches, 
                    Yasufumi Nekomata and Ikkei Ukai. Since the two teams' animal representatives (cats for Nekoma and crows for Karasuno) are animals 
                    that are usually found at the dumpster, the matches between the two teams are often called "Battle at the Garbage Dump" or 
                    "Trashcan Showdown" in the anime English dubbing.

                        Even though Nekoma is represented as cats (猫 Neko), the kanji in its name (音駒 Nekoma) are unrelated to the animal. 
                        Their actual meaning, "sound of [moving] a shogi piece", may be a reference to their play style of analysis and strategy.

                    <li>Nekoma has participated in the Spring High tournament eleven times and this time is their first appearance in five years.</li>

                        It's confirmed through Akane Yamamoto's introduction that there is a Nekoma Junior High. A Nekoma Grade School was also confirmed 
                        in one of Kuroo's flashbacks.
